# Decoding-Restaurant-Success-with-User-Engagement-
Our project analyzes Yelp data (8 cities) to see if diners' reviews, tips &amp; check-ins impact a restaurant's ratings &amp; reviews. We'll also explore how positive/negative sentiment and engagement trends over time affect success.  This intel helps owners boost engagement, improve satisfaction, and win big!
